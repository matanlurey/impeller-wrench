Some personal docs/tools for developing Impeller.

If any content in this repository is useful to you, feel free to use it. As I'm
super new, it's hard to understand if any of this is _generally_ useful, and if
it is I'll move it to a more appropriate place.

## Building the engine

The engine is built using [`gn`](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/), which is a
"meta-build system" that generates build files for the actual build system
(`ninja` in this case). The engine build is configured using `BUILD.gn` files.

This document assumes `gclient sync` has been run and the `src/flutter`
directory is present.

```bash
# Assumes you're in `$ENGINE/src`.
#
# Despite the name, this is not actually the gn binary. It's a wrapper script
# written in Python that invokes the gn binary, and sometimes the arguments are
# different (i.e. "enable_impeller_vulkan" versus "impeller_enable_vulkan").
./flutter/tools/gn
```

Common invocations:

```bash
# Assumes you're in `$ENGINE/src`.

# Build a host (i.e. on my Mac, a macOS binary) debug build.
./flutter/tools/gn --unopt

# Build an android debug build with Vulkan enabled and Vulkan validation layers.
./flutter/tools/gn --unopt --android --android-cpu=arm64 --enable-vulkan --enable-vulkan-validation-layers
```

Frequently used arguments:

| Name                   | GN Arg                            | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `android`              | `target_os=android`               | Build for Android.                                       |
| `android-cpu`          | -                                 | Build for a specific Android CPU. Defaults to `arm`.     |
| `enable-vulkan`        | `enable_vulkan`                   | Enable Vulkan.                                           |
| `enable-vulkan-layers` | `enable_vulkan_validation_layers` | Enable Vulkan validation layers.                         |
| `unoptimized`, `unopt` | `is_debug`                        | Set a bunch[^1] of flags you would want when developing. |

[^1]:
    In practice, [this roughly covers](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aflutter%2Fengine%20is_debug&type=code):
    (1) enables asserts in Dart (`--enable_asserts`), (2) calls `glGetError`
    after each OpenGL call (in Impeller), (3) does not strip symbols from
    compiled C++ code (i.e. `.so` files produced by `clang`), and (4) disables
    link-time optimization (LTO).

### Using Goma

[Goma](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/client/) is a distributed
compiler that builds C/C++ code in the cloud. It's sometimes used by the Flutter
engine team to speed up builds (it's not required, and some do not use it at
all). Goma has to be setup and authenticated before it can be used.

```py
# In `.gclient`; e.g. `$HOME/engine/.gclient`, add the following.

solutions = [
  {
    "custom_vars": {
      "use_cipd_goma": True,
    },
  },
]
```

In `$ENGINE/buildtools/mac-x64/goma` (or similar), you should have `goma_auth`:

```bash
$ ./buildtools/mac-x64/goma/goma_auth status
Login as ***@***.***
Ready to use Goma service at https://goma.chromium.org

# If needed (i.e. above command fails), run:
$ ./buildtools/mac-x64/goma/goma_auth login
```

And then, on a reboot:

```bash
./buildtools/mac-x64/goma/goma_ctl ensure_start
```

## Tips

### Change Open File Limit on Mac

When I was first [using Goma](#using-goma), I ran into the following error:

```bash
# Do not use autoninja (from depot_tools), as it doesn't work with our build.
$ ninja -j1000 -C out/host_debug
ninja: Entering directory `out/host_debug'
[0/5712] CXX obj/third_party/benchmark/src/libbenchmark.string_util.oninja: fatal: pipe: Too many open files
```

To check your limits:

```bash
launchctl limit maxfiles
ulimit -a
```

To adjust your limits (tested on OSX Ventura):

1. Reboot the system and enter recovery mode - keep cmd (âŒ˜) + R pressed
1. Disable system integrity check from terminal, by typing `csrutil disable`
1. Reboot
1. Create the files below
1. Reboot
1. Enable system integrity check, by typing `csrutil enable`
1. Reboot the system to complete the changes

```xml
<!-- /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
      <string>limit.maxfiles</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
      <array>
        <string>sudo</string>
        <string>launchctl</string>
        <string>limit</string>
        <string>maxfiles</string>
        <string>200000</string>
        <string>200000</string>
      </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
      <true/>
    <key>ServiceIPC</key>
      <false/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

```xml
<!-- /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple/DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
  <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
      <key>Label</key>
        <string>limit.maxproc</string>
      <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
          <string>sudo</string>
          <string>launchctl</string>
          <string>limit</string>
          <string>maxproc</string>
          <string>2048</string>
          <string>2048</string>
        </array>
      <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true />
      <key>ServiceIPC</key>
        <false />
    </dict>
  </plist>
```

Then change the owners and load these settings:

```bash
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist
```

### Disable Spotlight on Mac

See [Change Spotlight preferences on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-spotlight-preferences-mchlp2811/10.14/mac/10.14).

I disabled `Developer`, which is where I keep all my code:

![Disabled on `Developer`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/assets/168174/e51fac53-894a-453b-a547-35b163c3d2e8)
